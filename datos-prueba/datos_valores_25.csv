"18","CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')","The software constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.","Medium",""
"17","CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference","The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.","None"
"16","CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type","The software allows the attacker to upload or transfer files of dangerous types that can be automatically processed within the product's environment.","Medium",""
"1","CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer","The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.","High",""
"12","CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","High",""
"15","CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource","The software specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.","High",""
"13","CWE-287: Improper Authentication","When an actor claims to have a given identity, the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.","High"
"9","CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)","The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.","Medium",""
"8","CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.","Medium",""
"10","CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.","High",""
"7","CWE-416: Use After Free","Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code.","High","Updates are available. Please see the references or vendor advisory for more information."
"11","CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')","The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.","High",""
"5","CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","None",""
"6","CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')","The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.","High",""
"24","CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management","The software does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.","Medium",""
"25","CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation","The software does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.","None",""
"14","CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.","Medium",""
"23","CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data","The application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid.","Medium",""
"21","CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime","The software does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.","High",""
"20","CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The software does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.","High",""
"22","CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path","The application searches for critical resources using an externally-supplied search path that can point to resources that are not under the application's direct control.","High",""
"4","CWE-200: Information Exposure","An information exposure is the intentional or unintentional disclosure of information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.","High",""
"2","CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')","The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.","High",""
"19","CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials","The software contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data.","High",""
"3","CWE-20: Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.","High",""
