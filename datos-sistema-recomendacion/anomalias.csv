12,Out-of-bounds Write,"The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.",High,e
15,Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource,The software specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.,High,f
13,Improper Authentication,"When an actor claims to have a given identity, the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.",High,g
9,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),"The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.",Medium,h
8,Integer Overflow or Wraparound,"The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.",Medium,I
10,Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'),"The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.",High,j
7,Use After Free,"Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code.",High,Updates are available. Please see the references or vendor advisory for more information.
11,Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'),"The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.",High,k

25,Improper Certificate Validation,"The software does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.",None,o
14,NULL Pointer Dereference,"A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.",Medium,p
23,Deserialization of Untrusted Data,The application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid.,Medium,q
21,Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime,"The software does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.",High,recomendacion

3,Improper Input Validation,The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.,High,x
26,Injection.,"Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.",High,"
    The preferred option is to use a safe API, which avoids the use of the interpreter entirely or provides a parameterized interface, or migrate to use Object Relational Mapping Tools (ORMs). Note: Even when parameterized, stored procedures can still introduce SQL injection if PL/SQL or T-SQL concatenates queries and data, or executes hostile data with EXECUTE IMMEDIATE or exec().
    Use positive or “whitelist” server-side input validation. This is not a complete defense as many applications require special characters, such as text areas or APIs for mobile applications.
    For any residual dynamic queries, escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter. Note: SQL structure such as table names, column names, and so on cannot be escaped, and thus user-supplied structure names are dangerous. This is a common issue in report-writing software.
    Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass disclosure of records in case of SQL injection.
"
27,Broken Authentication.,"Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities temporarily or permanently.",Medium,"
    Where possible, implement multi-factor authentication to prevent automated, credential stuffing, brute force, and stolen credential re-use attacks.
    Do not ship or deploy with any default credentials, particularly for admin users.
    Implement weak-password checks, such as testing new or changed passwords against a list of the top 10000 worst passwords.
    Align password length, complexity and rotation policies with NIST 800-63 B’s guidelines in section 5.1.1 for Memorized Secrets or other modern, evidence based password policies.
    Ensure registration, credential recovery, and API pathways are hardened against account enumeration attacks by using the same messages for all outcomes.
    Limit or increasingly delay failed login attempts. Log all failures and alert administrators when credential stuffing, brute force, or other attacks are detected.
    Use a server-side, secure, built-in session manager that generates a new random session ID with high entropy after login. Session IDs should not be in the URL, be securely stored and invalidated after logout, idle, and absolute timeouts.
"
28,Sensitive Data Exposure.," Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection, such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when exchanged with the browser.",Medium,"
    Classify data processed, stored or transmitted by an application. Identify which data is sensitive according to privacy laws, regulatory requirements, or business needs.
    Apply controls as per the classification.
    Don’t store sensitive data unnecessarily. Discard it as soon as possible or use PCI DSS compliant tokenization or even truncation. Data that is not retained cannot be stolen.
    Make sure to encrypt all sensitive data at rest.
    Ensure up-to-date and strong standard algorithms, protocols, and keys are in place; use proper key management.
    Encrypt all data in transit with secure protocols such as TLS with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) ciphers, cipher prioritization by the server, and secure parameters. Enforce encryption using directives like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
    Disable caching for response that contain sensitive data.
    Store passwords using strong adaptive and salted hashing functions with a work factor (delay factor), such as Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt or PBKDF2.
    Verify independently the effectiveness of configuration and settings.
"
29,XML External Entities (XXE).,"Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents. External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks.",Medium,"
    Whenever possible, use less complex data formats such as JSON, and avoiding serialization of sensitive data.
    Patch or upgrade all XML processors and libraries in use by the application or on the underlying operating system. Use dependency checkers. Update SOAP to SOAP 1.2 or higher.
    Disable XML external entity and DTD processing in all XML parsers in the application, as per the OWASP Cheat Sheet ‘XXE Prevention’.
    Implement positive (“whitelisting”) server-side input validation, filtering, or sanitization to prevent hostile data within XML documents, headers, or nodes.
    Verify that XML or XSL file upload functionality validates incoming XML using XSD validation or similar.
    SAST tools can help detect XXE in source code, although manual code review is the best alternative in large, complex applications with many integrations.
"
30,Broken Access Control.,"Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other users’ accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, change access rights, etc.",Medium,"
    With the exception of public resources, deny by default.
    Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them throughout the application, including minimizing CORS usage.
    Model access controls should enforce record ownership, rather than accepting that the user can create, read, update, or delete any record.
    Unique application business limit requirements should be enforced by domain models.
    Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata (e.g. .git) and backup files are not present within web roots.
    Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate (e.g. repeated failures).
    Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated attack tooling.
    JWT tokens should be invalidated on the server after logout.
"
31,Security Misconfiguration.,"Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications be securely configured, but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.",High,"
    A repeatable hardening process that makes it fast and easy to deploy another environment that is properly locked down. Development, QA, and production environments should all be configured identically, with different credentials used in each environment. This process should be automated to minimize the effort required to setup a new secure environment.
    A minimal platform without any unnecessary features, components, documentation, and samples. Remove or do not install unused features and frameworks.
    A task to review and update the configurations appropriate to all security notes, updates and patches as part of the patch management process (see A9:2017-Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities). In particular, review cloud storage permissions (e.g. S3 bucket permissions).
    A segmented application architecture that provides effective, secure separation between components or tenants, with segmentation, containerization, or cloud security groups (ACLs).
    Sending security directives to clients
    An automated process to verify the effectiveness of the configurations and settings in all environments.
"
32,Cross-Site Scripting XSS,"XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.",High,"
    Using frameworks that automatically escape XSS by design, such as the latest Ruby on Rails, React JS. Learn the limitations of each framework’s XSS protection and appropriately handle the use cases which are not covered.
    Escaping untrusted HTTP request data based on the context in the HTML output (body, attribute, JavaScript, CSS, or URL) will resolve Reflected and Stored XSS vulnerabilities. The OWASP Cheat Sheet ‘XSS Prevention’ has details on the required data escaping techniques.
    Applying context-sensitive encoding when modifying the browser document on the client side acts against DOM XSS. When this cannot be avoided, similar context sensitive escaping techniques can be applied to browser APIs as described in the OWASP Cheat Sheet ‘DOM based XSS Prevention’.
    Enabling a Content Security Policy (CSP) as a defense-in-depth mitigating control against XSS. It is effective if no other vulnerabilities exist that would allow placing malicious code via local file includes (e.g. path traversal overwrites or vulnerable libraries from permitted content delivery networks).
"
33,Insecure Deserialization.,"Insecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution. Even if deserialization flaws do not result in remote code execution, they can be used to perform attacks, including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks.",Medium,"
    Implementing integrity checks such as digital signatures on any serialized objects to prevent hostile object creation or data tampering.
    Enforcing strict type constraints during deserialization before object creation as the code typically expects a definable set of classes. Bypasses to this technique have been demonstrated, so reliance solely on this is not advisable.
    Isolating and running code that deserializes in low privilege environments when possible.
    Log deserialization exceptions and failures, such as where the incoming type is not the expected type, or the deserialization throws exceptions.
    Restricting or monitoring incoming and outgoing network connectivity from containers or servers that deserialize.
    Monitoring deserialization, alerting if a user deserializes constantly.
"
34,Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities. ,"Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same privileges as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.",Medium,"
    Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation.
    Continuously inventory the versions of both client-side and server-side components (e.g. frameworks, libraries) and their dependencies using tools like versions, DependencyCheck, retire.js, etc. Continuously monitor sources like CVE and NVD for vulnerabilities in the components. Use software composition analysis tools to automate the process. Subscribe to email alerts for security vulnerabilities related to components you use.
    Only obtain components from official sources over secure links. Prefer signed packages to reduce the chance of including a modified, malicious component.
    Monitor for libraries and components that are unmaintained or do not create security patches for older versions. If patching is not possible, consider deploying a virtual patch to monitor, detect, or protect against the discovered issue.
"
35,Insufficient Logging & Monitoring.,"Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, and tamper, extract, or destroy data. Most breach studies show time to detect a breach is over 200 days, typically detected by external parties rather than internal processes or monitoring.",Medium,"
    Ensure all login, access control failures, and server-side input validation failures can be logged with sufficient user context to identify suspicious or malicious accounts, and held for sufficient time to allow delayed forensic analysis.
    Ensure that logs are generated in a format that can be easily consumed by a centralized log management solutions.
    Ensure high-value transactions have an audit trail with integrity controls to prevent tampering or deletion, such as append-only database tables or similar.
    Establish effective monitoring and alerting such that suspicious activities are detected and responded to in a timely fashion.
    Establish or adopt an incident response and recovery plan, such as NIST 800-61 rev 2 or later.
