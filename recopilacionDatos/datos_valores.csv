CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')	The software constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.	Medium
CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference	The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.	None

CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write	The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.	High
CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource	The software specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.	High

CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)	The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.	Medium
CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound	The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.	Medium
CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')	The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.	High
CWE-416: Use After Free	Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code.	High
CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')	The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.	High
CWE-617: Reachable Assertion	The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.	None
CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength	The software stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.	None
CWE-384: Session Fixation	Authenticating a user, or otherwise establishing a new user session, without invalidating any existing session identifier gives an attacker the opportunity to steal authenticated sessions.	None
CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read	The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.	None
CWE-532: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Log Files	Information written to log files can be of a sensitive nature and give valuable guidance to an attacker or expose sensitive user information.	Medium
CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function	The software does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.	High
CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')	The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.	High
CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling	The software allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.	High
CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization	The software performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. This allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.	High
CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)	The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.	None
CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')	A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks.	Low
CWE-862: Missing Authorization	The software does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.	High
CWE-415: Double Free	The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.	High
CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')	The program contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently.	Medium
CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast	The software does not correctly convert an object, resource, or structure from one type to a different type.	None
CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials	This weakness occurs when the application transmits or stores authentication credentials and uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.	None
CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')	The program contains an iteration or loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached, i.e., an infinite loop.	None
CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management	The software does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.	Medium
CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation	The software does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.	None
CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference	A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.	Medium
CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data	The application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid.	Medium
CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime	The software does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.	High
CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption	The software does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.	High
CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path	The application searches for critical resources using an externally-supplied search path that can point to resources that are not under the application's direct control.	High
CWE-200: Information Exposure	An information exposure is the intentional or unintentional disclosure of information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.	High
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')	The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.	High
CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials	The software contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data.	High
CWE-20: Improper Input Validation	The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.	High
