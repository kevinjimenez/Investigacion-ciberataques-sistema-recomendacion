This is due to the handling of CGI file name program requests.', 'By default, IIS performs two seperate actions on CGI requests. The first action decodes the file name to determine the file type (ie. .exe, .com, etc.) and the legitimacy of the file. IIS then carries out a security check. The final process decodes the CGI parameters, which determines whether the file will be processed or not.  ', 'The final process includes an undocumented third action. Not only does IIS identify the supplied CGI parameters, but it also decodes the previously security check approved CGI file name. Therefore, if a file name composed of escaped characters passes the security check, the second process will unescape the escaped characters contained in the file name, revealing the intended actions. Depending on what the escaped characters represent, varying actions may be performed. For example,', "'..%255c' represents '..\\', so decoding '..%255c' to '..\\' could leverage directory traversal attacks.

If you visit a compromised Web server, you will be prompted to download an .eml (Outlook Express) email file, which contains the worm as an attachment.
